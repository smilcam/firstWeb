          <h3 class="initPost"> Crab Dribble </h3>

          <p class="initCont">The Crab Dribble was made famous by Lebron James after he was upset to be called for a travel after shuffling his feet.
            The rule of traveling is always up for debate and the reason I think so is because superstars are almost never called for it.
            I think the league either needs to place a heavier emphasis on it or let all players take three steps. If Lebron James gets three
            sets than I think you should give it to Centers as well, if you let Dwight Howard have three steps in the post than you would see
            Centers start to dominate the game again. </p>

          <p> Lebron James is a goon and you probably have good ideas but i'm going to tell you that they suck, because for some reason
          the second I post things on the internet I no longer care about being tolerant towards others. </p>

            <p> So you understand that you turn into a total a-hole when you go online but yet you are incapable of stopping it?
            You got issues bro. However, in regards to the rule at hand i'd say there is an unspokane rule in the NBA
          that allows superstars to get away with more in-order to make the true superstars shine, because the league makes more money
        when they have iconic figures so no matter how much bitching we do with this rules nothing will ever come of it. </p>
